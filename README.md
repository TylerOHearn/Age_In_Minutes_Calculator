<h1 align="center">How Many Minutes</h1>
<h4 align="center">Age Calculator App</h4>

## Description
A simple proof of concept app that allows you to select your brithday using an [Android Date Picker Dialog](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DatePickerDialog), which will then calculate your age in minutes!

Written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) architecture and uses the [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) logging library, the app strives to provide a clean and organized codebase.

* Rewrite from [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) to [MVVM](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/android-mvvm-design-pattern) architecture
